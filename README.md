# Merc-Shop-Project
Hello, I'm Bothwell, a Fullstack web dev student at Hyperion Dev. This project is my Capstone project marking the completion of Level 1 of my studies, 2 to go. Basically demonstrating my skills in JS, Jquery, Css and Html - front end stuff.  

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:  
The site has 5 pages, with a store cart as the main feature, but havent done databases or the rest of stuff to make it a complete working online store.
Above the rest of required tasks, i added functionalities which include the following highlights:
> Responsive design  
> Using a Map(s) as my database for all the cars and fees, options  
> A Get-In-Touch panel that glides from the side. Lots of css class swapping goes on, almost gave up on it.  
> Get-In-Touch panel or subscribe will store your session details (name + contacts) for possible later convenience when u decide to buy and no need enter your same details again  
> Nav menu has hover info details such as total quantity added to cart, total cost of everything added to cart, factoring any discount coupons and vat  
> Animations and visual aid design for intuitive user experience througought.  
> Content is generally dynamically populated from within code  

CATALOGUE PAGE  
> Categorical display of the catalogue (products), Grid and table list. All added dynamically.  
> Quick add to cart, or first view details then add to cart  
> Visual indication when a vehicle has been added to cart  
> Visual indication with a tick in the nav menu when a stage is completed (1- adding an item to cart, 2- providing your shipping details, 3- placing your order)  

VEHICLE DETAILS PAGE  
> Image slider    
> Light, Dim, and Dark theme when viewing the car photos  
> Visual indication when a vehicle has been added to cart  
> WHen finished you can return back to your Catalogue/Cart page display page as it were & scroll position  

SHIPPING PAGE  
> Choose your shipping options  
> Provide your details  
> Highlight to you if you forget making an option or provide some details  


CART PAGE  
> Popup modal offering you a discount coupon if made available (appears only once a session and will show you where to find it next time)  
> Cart items are displayed in sort of a grid, showing image, car specs/details + option to change, shipping details + option to change, and resultant costs.  
> You can delete from cart  
> Scroll to position so that user visually confirms and knows what he/she is deleting  
> If you go to change vehicle details e.g. add more quantity or change color, or go change shipping details, it will return scroll position to where you were.  


NB:  
> There is some code and styles you'll probably advise to have been done differently/better, i also noticed opening the site on mobile (chrome) some few times the page would freeze a bit. Not sure if it was my code, or it's just the phone itself  
> Some of the material and content is not mine, used it only for educational purposes, and i added credit. 

......................................  
I think that's just about it  
Really enoyed it. Took me a few weeks of studying and implementing my own creativity.  
I love building any sort of systems and look forward to more challenging and rewarding projects as i build on this new career.  

Cheers
